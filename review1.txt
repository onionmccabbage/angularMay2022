Angular Review Exericse 1
=========================
Don't get bogged down - move on
Ask me, ask each other, look online
Enjoy (alter as you see fit)

Add a component called 'review'  ( ng generate component review )
In the review component .ts file declare a data-bound model for 'imgSize' ( use @Input() )
In the review component .html file place an image with 'width' bound to your 'imgSize' model
      <img src="https://placekitten.com/240/120" [width]="imgSize" />
Add two buttons bound to the 'click' event
One button should call a method to increase the 'imgSize' by 32 pixels
The other should decrease the 'imgSize' by 32 pixels
In both cases, make sure you are working with numeric values (rather than the default string values)
Remember to put an instance of your component into app.component.html

Now write a model object that specifies the image URL, some ALT text and some TITLE text
Bind these values in to the <img> tag

Next, write several of these objects in an array (each with different ALT and TITLE values)
Use *ngFor to iterate over this array, showing an <img> For each member of the array
All images should still have their 'width' controlled by the buttons

Optional
--------
Pass the initial image URL in to the 'review' component from the main 'app' component
In your size methods, ensure the size cannot go below 32 or above 1024
Find a way to have buttons to control how many images are shown, by adding or removing image data in the array
Also write code such that clicking an image will make it disappear from the page
 (decide between using [hidden], *ngIf or manipulating the array directly)
In the top level app, display how many images are currently in the array
Use a pipe to show the title of each <img> as upper-case text for every image

Super Optional
--------------
If you know how, pass the current value of 'imgSize' out to the parent component and display it's value there ( @Output() )
If you understand about form field binding, make a slider so the user can control the value of 'imgSize'
and another slider to control the number of images to be displayed
