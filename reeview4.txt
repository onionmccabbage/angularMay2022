Angular Review 4 until ~2:45
================
Begin a new Angular project 'ng new review4'

You will present the user with a form to specify which albumId they want
Then write a service to get all the photos for that albumId
  `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos?albumId=${albumId}`

Show all the returned photo details (e.g. in a table)
Clicking on an item in the table should show the actual image thumbnail

Optional
--------
Write an interface for a photo (NB this is different to this morning)
Data type your service so it returns an Observable<IPhoto[]>
Also enforce data types in your app

Write a separate component which is used to render an instance of a Photo
Then use this component in the iterator

Provide a means to delete items from the (local) data by clicking a row in the table
(pass the photo index and use it to .splice() the array)

Remember to handle ERRORS

NB feel free to apply interface and typings to the weather or wsapi examples
