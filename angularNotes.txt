- common practice
- existing project - understand existing code
- as much hands-on as possible
- labs exercises

Tuesday
> Welcome and introductions
> overview of Angular, cli, npm, archtecture
> preparation for Angular 5 development
> Modules, components, templates, data-binding interpolation
> modern ES best practices
> explore the prototype Angular app
> scaffolding application using cli
> pipes
> looping over complex model data
> *ngFor and *ngIf
> when we MUST explicitly data-type things - when TypeScript cannot infer the type
> simple event binding
> simple form binding [()] two-way binding
> passing bindings between components
> ()=>{} // variations...
> using the documentation

Wednesday
> HttpClient
> revisit @Input() and @Output() and data-bindings
> services
> Observables - .subscribe( ()=>{} )
> Typescript
> after lunch exercise
> production: AOT/JIT
> cache-busting
> separate NgModules transpile into ONE bundle...
> how do we install a particular version of Angular??
  npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
  then
  npm install -g @angular/cli // for the latest version
  npm install -g @angular/cli@1.7.4 // for Angular 5.x
> latest Angular version... see https://update.angular.io/
> compatibility issues, options when creating ng new
> typescript in LATEST Angular is even more strict

Versions of Angular
> package.json indicates the required version ~ ^

Thursday
> routing > how to target a routerOutlet
          > how to consume data passed to a route
> base
> routerLink syntax
> Forms: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms
> form field validation
> template directive - efficiency of NO redraw
> example: move from Angular 5 to recent Angular
> after lunch exercise
> Life-cycle events, ngOnInit event

q - can we determine the exact version of Angular being used
see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34907682/how-to-display-the-app-version-in-angular
Alterntatively see
<app-root _nghost-c0="" ng-version="4.4.7"><article _ngcontent-c0="">
</app-root>
Or just ng --version

> populate a table with *ngFor (and index) 
> passing an index to an iterable
> RxJS and Observables see https://v6.rxjs.dev/ and https://rxmarbles.com/
> building scalable apps (stateful apps) - use custom classes/interfaces
> difference between ng-template and ng-content
> using classes, interfaces and types (for typing, accessor/mutator etc.)
> bullet proofing code: try-catch-finally etc.
> generic design patterns
> after lunch exercise
> consolidate: what are the various 'directives'
> passing data around (inc persistent data)
> ECMAScript features: arrow functions, ...rest, back-ticks
