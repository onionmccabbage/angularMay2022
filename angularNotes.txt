> how do we install a particular version of Angular??
  npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
  then
  npm install -g @angular/cli // for the latest version
  npm install -g @angular/cli@1.7.4 // for Angular 5.x
> latest Angular version... see https://update.angular.io/
> compatibility issues, options when creating ng new
> typescript in LATEST Angular is even more strict
